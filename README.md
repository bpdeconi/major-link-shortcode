# Major Link Shortcode
## A demonstration of using Shortcake (Shortcode UI), as presented at UNC CAUSE 2016

Out of the box, this plugin adds a simple `[major-link]` shortcode, which adds a large-text link with an animated arrow. 

When the [Shortcake (Shortcode UI) plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-ui/) is activated with it, a simple user interface for inserting the shortcode can be used via the "Add Media" button. With Shortcake activated, the shortcode is also rendered as a preview in the WordPress Visual editor, giving content creators a truer WYSIWYG experience.
